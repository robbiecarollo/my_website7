# Climate change and temperature anomalies 


If we wanted to study climate change, we can find data on the *Combined Land-Surface Air and Sea-Surface Water Temperature Anomalies* in the Northern Hemisphere at [NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp). The [tabular data of temperature anomalies can be found here](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.txt)

To define temperature anomalies you need to have a reference, or base, period which NASA clearly states that it is the period between 1951-1980.

```{r weather_data, cache=TRUE}

weather <- 
  read_csv("https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.csv", 
           skip = 1, 
           na = "***")

```

```{r tidyweather}
#tidy data
tidyweather <- weather %>% 
  #select the year and months column (i.e. the first 13 columns)
  select(Year:Dec) %>% 
  #change format to long
  pivot_longer(cols = Jan:Dec, names_to = "month", values_to = "delta")

#inspect data
glimpse(tidyweather)
```

## Plotting Information

Let us plot the data using a time-series scatter plot, and add a trendline. 

```{r scatter_plot}
#create a new variable "date" to ensure our plot is in chronological order
tidyweather <- tidyweather %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(as.character(Year), month, "1")),
         month = month(date, label=TRUE),
         year = year(date))

ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Weather Anomalies" #add a more descriptive title
  )

```

Is the effect of increasing temperature more pronounced in some months?  

```{r facet_wrap}
#ordering by month the dataset
tidyweather$month = factor(tidyweather$month, levels = c("Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec"))

#scatter plot for each month
ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x = date, y = delta)) +
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color = "red")+
  facet_wrap(~month)+
  theme_bw()+
  labs(title = "Weather Anomalies for All Months")+
  NULL


```


It is sometimes useful to group data into different time periods to study historical data. 


```{r intervals}

comparison <- tidyweather %>% 
  filter(Year>= 1881) %>%     #remove years prior to 1881
  #create new variable 'interval', and assign values based on criteria below:
  mutate(interval = case_when(
    Year %in% c(1881:1920) ~ "1881-1920",
    Year %in% c(1921:1950) ~ "1921-1950",
    Year %in% c(1951:1980) ~ "1951-1980",
    Year %in% c(1981:2010) ~ "1981-2010",
    TRUE ~ "2011-present"
  ))

```

Now that we have the `interval` variable, we can create a density plot to study the distribution of monthly deviations (`delta`), grouped by the different time periods we are interested in. Set `fill` to `interval` to group and colour the data by different time periods.

```{r density_plot}

ggplot(comparison, aes(x=delta, fill=interval))+
  geom_density(alpha=0.2) +   #density plot with tranparency set to 20%
  theme_bw() +                #theme
  labs (
    title = "Density Plot for Monthly Temperature Anomalies",
    y     = "Density"         #changing y-axis label to sentence case
  )

```

So far, we have been working with monthly anomalies. However, we might be interested in average annual anomalies. We can do this by using `group_by()` and `summarise()`, followed by a scatter plot to display the result. 

```{r averaging}

#creating yearly averages
average_annual_anomaly <- tidyweather %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>%   #grouping data by Year
  
  # creating summaries for mean delta 
  # use `na.rm=TRUE` to eliminate NA (not available) values 
  summarise(annual_average_delta = mean(delta, na.rm=TRUE)) 

#plotting the data:
ggplot(average_annual_anomaly, aes(x= Year, y= annual_average_delta))+
  geom_point()+
  
  #Fit the best fit line, using LOESS method
  geom_smooth() +
  
  #change to theme_bw() to have white background + black frame around plot
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Average Yearly Anomaly", x = "Year", y = "Average Annual Delta"
  )                         


```
